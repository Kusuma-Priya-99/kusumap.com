        <p>For AR to work it needs precise object detection, rendering, occlusion and
            augmentation in real-time which required computational capabilities unavailable on most mobile devices.
            This protocol facilitates methods for dynamically provisioning compute between client and server, based on
            the device and network conditions to min-max latency and quality.

        <p>Created a 3d scanner that can scan , size and augment footwear on to a foot so a user can virtually try on
            footwear. This was done by using 3 mutually perpendicular cameras. The background op 3 Images captured are
            first removed. Then the images are "attached" to 3 sides of a voxel cube. The voxels are then hit tested in
            parallel with the images and all white pixels adjacent voxels are removed. Thus creating a 3d vertex cloud
            of the foot. The interior vertices of the point cloud is then removed. Then the vertex cloud is skinned with
            a fast parallel algorithm. The skinned mesh is then used for rendering the footwear. This is currently being
            Done on a i3 and a 1050 . Current progress is to make it work with a raspberry pi and a artix 7
