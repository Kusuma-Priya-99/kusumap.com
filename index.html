            <p>Jan 2020 - May 2020</p>
        </div>
        <p>Developed a hybrid recommendation model that concentrates on analyzing and differentiating two complex
            algorithms in use.
            Synthesized a hybrid matrix factorization optimized algorithm that is used to recommend
            items
            to the user by inculcating Alternating Least Squares (ALS) in the initial
            stage and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the advanced stage. This approach can be easily implemented in the real world as the problem of cold start can be easily
            reduced.
            Compared to the traditional technique, this technique shows an increase in accuracy.

            <p>Oct 2018 - Dec 2018</p>
        </div>
        <p>Directly led a three-person project team in developing a personalized movie recommendation system. This
            project is based on an item-based collaborative filtering algorithm in which user preference based on the
            movie genre is added to the movie rating in order to compute the similarity aimed at user preference. This
            technique can
            reduce the amount of data and improve the quality of recommendations. The experimental results indicate that
            the approach outperforms the traditional user-user and item-item collaborative filtering methods.
            <br>
            Delivered a paper on the above-mentioned project at the third international conference,
            ICEECCOT-2018, which was held at the GSSS Institute of Engineering and Technology in Mysore.
